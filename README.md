# abi-DCM
A Python library for Automated Bayesian Inference in Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM)

# Description

This repository contains Python code for efficient Bayesian Inference in DCM, including routines for Gradient-Descent and Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.

# Dependencies

- [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/)

- [JAXopt](https://jaxopt.github.io)

- [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/)

- [vbjax](https://github.com/ins-amu/vbjax)

# Installation and use

First install ![Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/main)

### Create a Python environment and its IPython kernel
conda env create -f environment.yml \
conda activate abi-DCM \
python -m ipykernel install --user --name abi-DCM \
conda deactivate

### Download the code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/brainets/abi-DCM.git $HOME/abi-DCM

### Run the examples on JupyterLab
conda install conda-forge::jupyterlab \
cd $HOME/abi-DCM/examples \
jupyter-lab & \

(once JupyterLab opens up, choose *abi-dcm* as IPython Kernel)
